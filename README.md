# University Practice

Thing I did in university for my C# operation system's programming course.

# Can I use it?

If it comparable with your task - sure, why not. But I really suggest you to read the code and make some comments for yourself.

# What I Learned?

- How to manage threads in C#;
- How to work with memory in C#;
- C# Windows Forms;
- File management;
- How to make CLI with C# (terrible experience);
- Multithreading in C# and ownership.
